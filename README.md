Clean Facebook Newsfeed Filter Bubble with Polysingularity Practice
=====================================================

This Chrome extension deletes your facebook news and replaces it with referenes to the studies about Facebook effects on one's mood, wellbeing, and social relations, 
as well as some practical advices to redirect your behavior into the direction that gives you more choices than the filter bubble that Facebook locks you in.

You can change the quotes that are shown in the newsfeed to the ones you like if you fork the repository, edit the eradicate.js file, and then install the modified version of this extension into your Chrome browser (download the zip, unzip, then install using Developer Mode in your Chrome).

This project was originally forked from [news feed eradicator](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator) 

More information on the background of the project and rationale behind its work: [Nodus Labs](http://noduslabs.com/cases/clean-facebook-newsfeed-filter-bubble). 

This project is part of Nodus Labs' work on [Cognitive Interfaces](http://noduslabs.com/research/cognitive-interfaces-transcendental-protocols/) â€“ the tools and practices that change our perception, cognition, and behavior towards a more adaptive and evolutionary-friendly direction.
