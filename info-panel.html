    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Facebook locks you into a filter bubble. In order to better serve advertisement it shows you the info that gets the most likes from your friends, making it harder for you to discover new, unexpected stuff. News Feed, in this case, becomes the main source of distraction and time wasting, because it just feeds you with what you already know. So it may be engaging, but it will not change anything. 
        <br><br>
        At the same time, there are many positive sides to Facebook and interesting features that are a bit hidden from users. 
        Like all those new people that you can find, the groups where you can discover new stuff, and even – if you observe the way you are using it – you can find out a lot of new things about yourself as well.
        <br><br>
        In order to leave only the good parts in Facebook, we made this app, which simply blocks your newsfeed.<br><br>
        <b>The main strategy is to divert your attention from Newsfeed to:</b> <br><br>
        a) Self-awareness (showing the interesting facts about Facebook and human behavior from scientific research);<br><br>
        b) Hidden interesting Facebook features (like Graph Search) that will expand your social circle and help you discover new stuff;<br><br>
        c) Physical and cognitive exercises designed to shift your attention and physicality and remove tension;<br>
        <br><br>
        If you have any ideas for more strategies or want to make your own version of this app, please contact us on
